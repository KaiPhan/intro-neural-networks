    "\n",
    "In the context of a probabilistic model, MLE is a method of estimating the parameters of the model that maximizes the likelihood function. The likelihood function measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In above example, if we're trying to model the occurrence of flu in a population, we would choose the model that gives the highest probability to the observed data. If 55% of people in our sample have the flu, then a model that predicts a 55% chance of flu would be a better fit than one that predicts an 80% chance. However, if 80% of people in our sample have the flu, then the model predicting an 80% chance would be a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It's important to note that MLE doesn't tell us the probability of the model being correct**. It simply tells us **which model is the best fit for our data** given the models you are considering. Also, MLE assumes our sample is representative of the population. If our sample is biased, our estimates could be off. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(Take away)** So, in summary, the best model is the one that most accurately represents the observed data.  \n",
    "The size of the sample just affects the precision of your estimates.\n"
