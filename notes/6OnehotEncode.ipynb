    "In a nutshell, one-hot encoding is a method used in machine learning to represent categorical data, particularly for features or labels with distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** representing categories as binary vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - It prevents the model from assuming an ordinal relationship between categories that may not exist.\n",
    "  - It ensures that the categorical data is treated appropriately, especially in scenarios where numerical values may mislead the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Usage:** One-hot encoding is frequently used in tasks involving categorical variables, such as encoding class labels in classification problems or converting nominal features into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Libraries like scikit-learn in Python provide functions (e.g., `OneHotEncoder`) \n",
